## üîç Overview

The Azure DevOps Toolbox is a comprehensive collection of reusable pipeline templates, configurations, and tools designed to accelerate DevOps workflows in Azure DevOps. This repository serves as a reference implementation for common DevOps scenarios, providing ready-to-use solutions that can be adapted to specific project requirements.

The toolbox includes solutions for:
- Container deployment to virtual machines
- Kubernetes deployment to Amazon EKS
- Kubernetes deployment to on-premises clusters
- Pull request notification automation via Microsoft Teams

Each solution is documented with detailed explanations, usage instructions, and diagrams to facilitate implementation.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following folders, each with specific Azure DevOps pipeline examples and tools:

### üê≥ [deploy-container](./deploy-container)

Tools and pipelines for deploying containerized applications to virtual machines.

- **deploy-container-job.yml**: Reusable template for container deployment jobs
- **pipeline-deploy-container.yml**: Complete pipeline for building and deploying containers to development and production environments

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è [deploy-eks](./deploy-eks)

Tools and pipelines for deploying applications to Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

- **pipeline-deploy-kubernetes.yml**: Pipeline for deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è [deploy-on-prem-kubernetes](./deploy-on-prem-kubernetes)

Tools and pipelines for deploying containerized applications to on-premises Kubernetes clusters.

- **pipeline-deploy-kubernetes.yml**: Pipeline for building Docker images and deploying them to on-premises Kubernetes clusters with dynamic manifest generation

### üì¢ [notify-pull-request-reviewers](./notify-pull-request-reviewers)

Tools for automating pull request notifications to reviewers via Microsoft Teams.

- **adaptive-card-teams.json**: Adaptive Card template for Teams notifications
- **azure-devops-pull-request-notification.json**: Azure Logic App workflow definition for sending notifications

## üîë Key Concepts

### üìã Pipeline Templates

Pipeline templates are reusable components that define common job patterns. They help standardize deployment processes across multiple pipelines and reduce duplication. In this repository, templates like `deploy-container-job.yml` encapsulate complex deployment logic that can be referenced by multiple pipeline definitions.

### üîÑ Multi-Stage Pipelines

Azure DevOps multi-stage pipelines allow you to define separate stages for building, testing, and deploying applications. This repository demonstrates how to structure pipelines with distinct stages for different environments (development, production), enabling controlled progression through deployment environments.

### üåê Environment Resources

Azure DevOps environments represent deployment targets like virtual machines or Kubernetes clusters. The pipelines in this repository show how to target specific environments and resources, enabling controlled deployments with appropriate approvals and checks.

### üîå Service Connections

Service connections in Azure DevOps provide secure access to external services like container registries, Kubernetes clusters, and cloud platforms. The examples in this repository demonstrate how to reference service connections in pipeline definitions.

### ‚ö° Logic Apps Integration

Azure Logic Apps can be used to extend Azure DevOps capabilities through webhooks and service hooks. The pull request notification system in this repository shows how to integrate Azure DevOps events with Logic Apps to automate communication workflows.

## üìù Usage

To use the examples in this repository:

1. **Clone or Fork the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alegarciadelrio/azuredevops.git
   ```

2. **Select the Appropriate Example**:
   - For container deployments: Use the files in the `deploy-container` folder
   - For Kubernetes deployments on Amazon EKS: Use the files in the `deploy-eks` folder
   - For Kubernetes deployments on on-premises clusters: Use the files in the `deploy-on-prem-kubernetes` folder
   - For pull request notifications: Use the files in the `notify-pull-request-reviewers` folder

3. **Customize the Configuration**:
   - Update variables, parameters, and service connection IDs to match your environment
   - Modify deployment targets and resource names as needed
   - Adjust pipeline triggers to match your branching strategy

4. **Import into Azure DevOps**:
   - Create a new pipeline in your Azure DevOps project
   - Select "Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file"
   - Point to the appropriate YAML file in your repository

5. **Set Up Required Resources**:
   - Configure environments and resources in Azure DevOps
   - Create necessary service connections
   - Set up approval policies if needed

Refer to the README.md file in each folder for detailed, solution-specific usage instructions.
